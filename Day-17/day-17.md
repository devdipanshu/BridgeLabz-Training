# Day 17 – Fundoo Notes Application

## 📌 Overview

As part of **Day 17 of the Refresher Training**, I continued the development of the **Fundoo Notes Application** and implemented **Redis Caching** and **RabbitMQ** to improve application performance and introduce asynchronous message communication.

I also configured **Memurai** as the Redis-compatible service for local development and used **Docker** to create and run a RabbitMQ container with the Management Plugin.

The Fundoo application is currently developed using a **Monolithic Architecture**.

## 🚀 Work Completed

### 1. Redis Cache Implementation

Implemented **Redis Caching** in the Fundoo Notes Application to reduce unnecessary database calls and improve application performance.

#### Key Implementations

* Integrated Redis with Spring Boot.
* Configured Spring Cache.
* Used `@EnableCaching` to enable caching support.
* Implemented `@Cacheable` for frequently accessed data.
* Implemented `@CacheEvict` for cache invalidation.
* Configured cache expiration using TTL.
* Configured Redis serialization.
* Tested cache hit and cache miss scenarios.
* Used **Memurai** as the Redis-compatible service on Windows.

#### Cache Flow

```text
Client Request
      |
      v
Spring Boot Application
      |
      v
Check Redis Cache
      |
   +--+--+
   |     |
 Hit    Miss
   |     |
   v     v
Return  Database
 Data      |
           v
       Store Data
        in Redis
           |
           v
      Return Data
```

When the requested data is already available in Redis, the application returns the cached data without making another database query.

When the data is not available in Redis, the application fetches it from the database and stores the result in Redis for subsequent requests.

---

## 2. Memurai Integration

Configured **Memurai** as the Redis-compatible service for the local development environment.

Memurai was used to provide Redis functionality on Windows.

### Memurai Responsibilities

* Run Redis-compatible service locally.
* Store cached application data.
* Handle cache read and write operations.
* Support TTL-based cache expiration.
* Test Redis integration with Spring Boot.

---

## 3. Spring Cache Configuration

Configured Spring Boot caching support for Redis.

The application uses Spring Cache annotations to manage cached data.

### `@Cacheable`

`@Cacheable` is used to store the method response in Redis.

On the first request:

```text
Request
   ↓
Redis Cache
   ↓
Data Not Found
   ↓
Database
   ↓
Store Result in Redis
   ↓
Return Response
```

On subsequent requests:

```text
Request
   ↓
Redis Cache
   ↓
Data Found
   ↓
Return Cached Data
```

This prevents repeated database queries for the same frequently accessed data.

### `@CacheEvict`

`@CacheEvict` is used to remove outdated cached data when the underlying database data is modified or deleted.

```text
Update/Delete Data
        ↓
Database Updated
        ↓
Cache Evicted
        ↓
Next Request
        ↓
Fresh Data from Database
```

## 4. RabbitMQ Implementation

Implemented **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous communication in the Fundoo Notes Application.

RabbitMQ provides message-based communication between different components of the application.

### Key Implementations

* Added RabbitMQ dependency.
* Configured RabbitMQ connection.
* Created RabbitMQ configuration.
* Configured Exchange.
* Configured Queue.
* Configured Binding.
* Implemented Producer.
* Implemented Consumer.
* Published messages from the application.
* Consumed messages from the queue.
* Tested message flow successfully.

---

## 5. RabbitMQ Architecture

The implemented RabbitMQ communication follows this flow:

```text
Producer
   |
   v
Exchange
   |
   v
Binding
   |
   v
Queue
   |
   v
Consumer
   |
   v
Message Processing
```

### Producer

The Producer is responsible for publishing messages to RabbitMQ.

```text
Application Event
       ↓
   Producer
       ↓
    RabbitMQ
```

### Exchange

The Exchange receives messages from the Producer and routes them to the appropriate Queue based on the configured binding.

### Queue

The Queue stores messages until they are consumed.

### Consumer

The Consumer listens to the Queue and processes incoming messages.

```text
Queue
  ↓
Consumer
  ↓
Process Message
```

---

## 6. RabbitMQ with Docker

Configured RabbitMQ using **Docker** for the local development environment.

A RabbitMQ container was created using the RabbitMQ image with the **Management Plugin**.

### Docker Setup

The RabbitMQ container provides:

* RabbitMQ message broker.
* RabbitMQ Management UI.
* Queue management.
* Exchange management.
* Binding management.
* Message monitoring.
* Containerized RabbitMQ environment.

### RabbitMQ Docker Flow

```text
Docker
  |
  v
RabbitMQ Container
  |
  +---- RabbitMQ Server
  |
  +---- Management Plugin
  |
  +---- Exchanges
  |
  +---- Queues
  |
  +---- Bindings
```

Using Docker keeps RabbitMQ isolated from the host environment and makes the messaging infrastructure easier to start and manage during development.

---

## 7. RabbitMQ Management

The RabbitMQ Management Plugin was used to monitor and manage the RabbitMQ environment.

The Management UI can be used to check:

* Queues
* Exchanges
* Bindings
* Connections
* Channels
* Message rates
* Consumers
* Queue status

This helped in verifying that messages were successfully published and consumed.

---

## 🔄 Combined Redis + RabbitMQ Flow

The Fundoo application now contains both caching and asynchronous messaging components.

```text
                  Fundoo Application
                         |
             +-----------+-----------+
             |                       |
             v                       v
        Redis Cache              RabbitMQ
             |                       |
             v                       v
         Memurai                  Producer
                                     |
                                     v
                                  Exchange
                                     |
                                     v
                                   Queue
                                     |
                                     v
                                  Consumer
```

Redis is used for **fast data access and caching**, while RabbitMQ is used for **asynchronous message communication**.
